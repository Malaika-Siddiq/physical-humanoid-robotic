# Manipulation and Dexterity in Humanoid Robots

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of robotic manipulation
- Analyze dexterous hand design and control
- Evaluate manipulation planning and execution strategies

## Overview
Manipulation is a critical capability for humanoid robots, enabling them to interact with objects and perform tasks in human environments. This lesson explores the mechanical and control aspects of dexterous manipulation.

## Hand Design and Actuation
- **Anthropomorphic hands**: Mimicking human hand structure and capabilities
- **Underactuated hands**: Balancing complexity with functionality
- **Tactile sensing**: Distributed touch feedback for manipulation
- **Grasp synthesis**: Planning stable and effective grasps

## Kinematics and Control
- **Forward kinematics**: Computing end-effector position from joint angles
- **Inverse kinematics**: Determining joint angles for desired end-effector positions
- **Jacobian matrices**: Relating joint velocities to end-effector velocities
- **Redundancy resolution**: Managing excess degrees of freedom

## Manipulation Planning
- **Motion planning**: Computing collision-free paths for manipulation
- **Grasp planning**: Determining optimal grasp configurations
- **Task planning**: Sequencing manipulation actions to achieve goals
- **Multi-arm coordination**: Coordinating multiple manipulators

## Exercises
1. Analyze the trade-offs between anthropomorphic and specialized hand designs
2. Design a simple grasp planning algorithm for a specific object

## Summary
Dexterous manipulation requires sophisticated integration of mechanical design, sensing, and control to enable humanoid robots to interact effectively with their environment.
