# Force Control and Compliant Manipulation

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of force control in robotic manipulation
- Analyze compliant control strategies for safe interaction
- Evaluate impedance and admittance control approaches

## Overview
Force control enables humanoid robots to interact safely and effectively with their environment by controlling the forces applied during manipulation tasks. This is crucial for tasks requiring physical contact with objects or humans.

## Force Control Fundamentals
- **Force/torque sensing**: Measuring interaction forces and moments
- **Hybrid position/force control**: Combining position and force control
- **Natural coordinates**: Identifying unconstrained and constrained directions
- **Stability considerations**: Ensuring stable force control behavior

## Impedance Control
- **Impedance models**: Relating force to position deviations
- **Variable impedance**: Adjusting mechanical impedance for task requirements
- **Virtual fixtures**: Using impedance control to guide motion
- **Safety considerations**: Limiting forces for human safety

## Admittance Control
- **Admittance models**: Relating motion to applied forces
- **Human-robot interaction**: Enabling compliant response to human guidance
- **Environmental adaptation**: Adjusting to unknown environment properties
- **Stability analysis**: Ensuring stable admittance control

## Exercises
1. Design an impedance controller for a specific manipulation task
2. Compare impedance and admittance control for human-robot interaction

## Summary
Force control and compliant manipulation are essential for safe and effective physical interaction between humanoid robots and their environment.
