# Fundamentals of Locomotion and Balance

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of bipedal locomotion
- Analyze balance control mechanisms in humanoid robots
- Compare different walking algorithms and their applications

## Overview
Bipedal locomotion is one of the most challenging aspects of humanoid robotics, requiring sophisticated control algorithms to maintain balance while moving. This lesson explores the fundamental principles that enable humanoid robots to walk, run, and maintain stability.

## Bipedal Gait Mechanics
- **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: The point where the net moment of ground reaction forces is zero
- **Capture Point**: The location where a robot must step to come to a complete stop
- **Inverted Pendulum Model**: Simplified representation of balance dynamics
- **Double Inverted Pendulum**: More complex model including upper body dynamics

## Balance Control Strategies
- **Feedback control**: Real-time adjustment based on sensor measurements
- **Feedforward control**: Pre-planned motion trajectories
- **Compliant control**: Adapting to environmental disturbances
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: Optimization-based control approaches

## Walking Algorithms
- **Static walking**: Maintaining stability at all times during movement
- **Dynamic walking**: Using momentum and controlled falling
- **Walking pattern generators**: Pre-computed or learned walking patterns
- **Adaptive walking**: Adjusting to terrain and environmental changes

## Exercises
1. Compare the ZMP and Capture Point approaches to balance control
2. Analyze the trade-offs between static and dynamic walking approaches

## Summary
Effective locomotion and balance control are fundamental to humanoid robot mobility, requiring sophisticated integration of control theory, mechanics, and real-time computation.
