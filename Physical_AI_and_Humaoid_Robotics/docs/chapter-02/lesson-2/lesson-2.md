# Dynamic Stability and Control

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze dynamic stability in moving humanoid robots
- Understand control methods for maintaining stability during motion
- Evaluate different approaches to disturbance rejection

## Overview
Dynamic stability refers to the ability of a humanoid robot to maintain balance while in motion. This requires sophisticated control strategies that can respond to both planned movements and unexpected disturbances.

## Stability Analysis
- **Lyapunov stability**: Mathematical framework for analyzing stability
- **Phase space analysis**: Understanding state trajectories and stability regions
- **Stability margins**: Quantifying the robustness of balance control
- **Bifurcation analysis**: Understanding transitions between stable states

## Control Approaches
- **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**: Optimal control for linearized systems
- **Sliding mode control**: Robust control in the presence of uncertainties
- **Adaptive control**: Adjusting control parameters based on system behavior
- **Neural network control**: Learning-based approaches to stability control

## Disturbance Handling
- **External disturbances**: Push recovery and robustness to environmental forces
- **Internal disturbances**: Handling sensor noise and actuator variations
- **Recovery strategies**: Techniques for regaining stability after disturbances
- **Fall prevention**: Detection and avoidance of fall conditions

## Exercises
1. Design a simple balance controller for a 2D inverted pendulum
2. Compare the performance of different control approaches for disturbance rejection

## Summary
Dynamic stability control is essential for safe and robust operation of humanoid robots in real-world environments.
