# Sensory Systems and Perception in Humanoid Robots

## Learning Objectives
- Identify the key sensory modalities in humanoid robots
- Understand how sensory data is processed and integrated
- Analyze the role of perception in robot-environment interaction

## Overview
Sensory systems are crucial for humanoid robots to interact effectively with their environment. These systems provide the input necessary for decision-making, navigation, and human-robot interaction.

## Visual Perception
- **Cameras**: Stereo vision systems for depth perception
- **Computer vision**: Object recognition, facial recognition, and scene understanding
- **Eye tracking**: Gaze control and social interaction capabilities
- **Visual SLAM**: Simultaneous localization and mapping for navigation

## Tactile and Haptic Sensing
- **Force/torque sensors**: For manipulation and interaction force control
- **Tactile arrays**: Distributed touch sensing across robot surfaces
- **Haptic feedback**: Providing touch-based information to users
- **Proprioception**: Internal sensing of joint positions and forces

## Auditory Systems
- **Microphone arrays**: Sound source localization and noise filtering
- **Speech recognition**: Understanding human language input
- **Voice synthesis**: Natural language generation and communication
- **Audio scene analysis**: Environmental sound recognition

## Integration and Sensor Fusion
- **Multimodal processing**: Combining information from multiple sensors
- **Kalman filtering**: Estimating state from noisy sensor data
- **Bayesian inference**: Reasoning under uncertainty with sensor data
- **Real-time processing**: Managing computational demands of sensor fusion

## Exercises
1. Design a sensor layout for a humanoid robot intended for home assistance
2. Evaluate the trade-offs between different sensor technologies for a specific application

## Summary
Effective sensory systems enable humanoid robots to perceive and understand their environment, forming the foundation for intelligent behavior and interaction.

## Next Up
Chapter 2 will explore the fundamentals of locomotion and balance in humanoid robots.
