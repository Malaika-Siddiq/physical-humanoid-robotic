# Anatomy and Biomechanics of Humanoid Robots

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the structural components of humanoid robots
- Analyze the biomechanical principles underlying humanoid design
- Compare different actuation and transmission systems

## Overview
Humanoid robots are designed to mimic human form and function, requiring careful consideration of anatomical structure and biomechanical principles. This lesson explores the key components that enable humanoid robots to move and interact with their environment.

## Structural Components
- **Torso and spine**: Central support structure with degrees of freedom for upper body movement
- **Upper extremities**: Arms, shoulders, and hands with multiple joints for manipulation tasks
- **Lower extremities**: Legs, hips, and feet designed for locomotion and balance
- **Head and neck**: Sensory systems and orientation capabilities

## Actuation Systems
Different actuation technologies enable movement in humanoid robots:
- Servo motors for precise joint control
- Pneumatic and hydraulic systems for force generation
- Series elastic actuators for compliant control
- Tendon-driven systems for biomimetic movement

## Biomechanical Principles
Humanoid robots incorporate principles from human biomechanics:
- Center of mass control for balance
- Inverse kinematics for movement planning
- Dynamic stability during locomotion
- Force distribution across joints

## Exercises
1. Compare the actuation systems used in different humanoid robots (e.g., ASIMO, Atlas, Sophia)
2. Analyze the trade-offs between biomimetic design and functional efficiency

## Summary
Understanding the anatomical and biomechanical foundations of humanoid robots is essential for developing effective control strategies and interaction capabilities.

## Next Up
In the next lesson, we'll examine the sensory systems that enable humanoid robots to perceive their environment.
