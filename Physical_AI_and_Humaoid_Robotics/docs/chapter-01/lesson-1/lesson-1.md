# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Learning Objectives
- Define Physical AI and its relationship to humanoid robotics
- Understand the historical development of humanoid robots
- Identify key challenges and opportunities in the field

## Overview
Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical embodiment. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital domains, Physical AI systems interact with the real world through sensors and actuators, enabling more sophisticated understanding and manipulation of physical environments.

## Historical Context
The development of humanoid robots has evolved significantly over the past several decades, from early mechanical automata to today's sophisticated AI-powered systems. This evolution has been driven by advances in materials science, control theory, machine learning, and computational power.

## Key Concepts
- Embodied cognition and its role in intelligent behavior
- Sensorimotor integration in physical systems
- The importance of human-like form in human-robot interaction

## Exercises
1. Research a historical humanoid robot and compare its capabilities to modern systems
2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of humanoid form factors

## Summary
This lesson introduced the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, establishing the foundation for deeper exploration in subsequent lessons.

## Next Up
In the next lesson, we'll explore the anatomy and biomechanics of humanoid robots.
