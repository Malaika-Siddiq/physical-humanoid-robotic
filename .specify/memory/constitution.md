# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-Spec-Driven Development
Every feature and content piece starts with a clear specification; All content must be designed with AI integration in mind; Each section must be structured to support RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities and AI understanding.

### II. Multi-Modal Accessibility
All content must be accessible in multiple formats; Textbook supports both English and Urdu languages; Content is structured for both human learning and AI processing; Personalization features must be optional but available for different learning styles.

### III. Test-First Content Creation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All educational content follows a test-first approach: Learning objectives defined → Assessment questions created → Content developed to meet objectives; Each section must include verification mechanisms; Red-Green-Refactor cycle applies to content quality.

### IV. Modular and Scalable Architecture
Content must be organized in modular, interconnected units; Each module should stand alone while contributing to the larger educational framework; Docusaurus-based structure ensures scalability and maintainability; Content updates should not break existing learning paths.

### V. Interactive Learning Experience
All content must incorporate interactive elements; RAG chatbot integration required for real-time Q&A; Personalization features to adapt to individual learning pace and style; Practical examples and hands-on exercises integrated throughout.

### VI. Technical Excellence and Documentation
All code examples and technical explanations must be accurate and well-documented; Best practices for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics implementation clearly articulated; Standards and protocols for humanoid robotics development included.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development and content creation for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All contributions must align with these principles. Amendments require documentation of the change, approval from project maintainers, and a migration plan for existing content. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear educational or technical benefits. Use this constitution as the primary guidance for all development decisions.
